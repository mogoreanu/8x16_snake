About STC MCU Compiler/Assembler :
1. Any traditional compiler / assembler and the popular Keil C51 are suitable for STC MCU.
2. For selection MCU body, the traditional compiler / assembler, you can choose Intel's 8052 / 87C52 / 87C52
/ 87C58 or Philips's P87C52 / P87C54/P87C58 in the traditional environment, in Keil environment, you
can choose the types in front of the proposed or download the STC chips database file (STC.CDB) from the
STC official website

If you are just playing around I would suggest IAP15W4K61S4-30I-PDIP40, which is the flagship of their entire product line, pin-to-pin compatible with other STC15 chips in DIP-40 package, supports on-chip debug, and have Von Newmann-connected internal ROM (through the use of EEPROM access registers)
Or if you are okay with a bit less than the best, I can send you a IAP15L2K61S2-28I-PDIP40 - the extra I got from the sample order. That chip runs only at 3.3V (instead of 2.7-5.5V range for the STC15W variant,) have 2 UARTs instead of 4 and half the RAM.

For KEIL-C51 compiler, to assign the variables to be located at Auxiliary RAM, the “pdata” or “xdata” definition
should be used

unsigned char xdata test_array_one[512] = { 0x00, 0x01, ... }

Figure out what's up with the bit-addressable "data" range ... is there a bit-addressable range I can store my vars in?

Figure out what's up with the ACC register and whether it can be used directly in the app.

Using IO port drive LED directly or matrix key scan, needs add a 470ohm to 1Kohm resistor to limit current, yeah ...
